Status
------

With original Apple ][ ROM it boots to monitor fine, most monitor commands
work and you can go into Integer BASIC (with E000G) and write and run BASIC
programs. Other ROMs have not been tested in any detail yet.

The only I/O supported is the keyboard and text mode screen.

Curses is currently used for the screen, but I'll likely switch to Pygame.
